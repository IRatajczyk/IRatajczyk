Hi, Iâ€™m Igor Ratajczyk, Eng aka @IRatajczyk.

Control Engineer.

Iâ€™m interested in âœ¨Computer Vision Systemsâœ¨ and Reinforcement Learning for Continuous Control. I do enjoy Julia.

I'm look forward to collaborating on projects covering Vision Transformers, GANs and High Performance ML for edge devices.

ðŸ“« Should you be interested in collaboration or have any doubts about my projects (both Github and non-yet-publised ones) please contact me directly: igor@ratajczyk.eu

Here is brief summary of my projects, not every one of them is published in Github.
